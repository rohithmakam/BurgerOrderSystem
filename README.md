## Features

- **Customizable Meal Orders:** Create meals with regular burgers (up to 3 toppings) or deluxe burgers (up to 5 free toppings, e.g., bacon, avocado).
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Calculates costs based on toppings (e.g., $1.50 for bacon, $1.00 for cheese) and sizes (small: -$0.50, large: +$1.00).
- **Itemized Billing:** Generates formatted receipts detailing burgers, toppings, drinks, sides, and total price.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes inheritance (Burger and DeluxeBurger extend Item), polymorphism, and encapsulation for modular code.
- **Extensible:** Easily supports additional menu items or pricing rules.

## Installation

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohithmakam/BurgerOrderSystem.git
cd BurgerOrderSystem
```

**Compile the Project:**
```bash
javac *.java
```
Alternatively, open the project in a Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) and build it using the IDEâ€™s tools.

## Usage

Run the main application:
```bash
java Main
```
The program demonstrates a sample deluxe burger meal with toppings, a drink, and a side. To enable interactive ordering, modify `Main.java` to use `Scanner` for user input (sample code available in prior versions).

**Sample Output:**
```
           BASE BURGER:   8.50
           TOPPING LETTUCE:   0.00
           TOPPING CHEESE:   0.00
           TOPPING MAYO:   0.00
           TOPPING AVOCADO:   0.00
           TOPPING BACON:   0.00
           SMALL PEPSI:   0.00
           CHILLI:   0.00
------------------------------
           DELUXE BURGER:   8.50
           TOTAL PRICE:   8.50
```
